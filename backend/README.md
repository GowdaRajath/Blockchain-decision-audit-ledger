# Backend — Integrity & Verification Logic

This backend layer demonstrates how decision payloads are:
- Normalised
- Cryptographically hashed
- Verified against blockchain-stored proofs

The backend is intentionally simple and focuses on:
- Integrity verification
- Separation of concerns
- Support for analytics and dashboards

This layer represents the bridge between off-chain data and on-chain audit events.
