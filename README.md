# Blockchain-Based Decision Audit Ledger

## Abstract

This project explores the use of blockchain technology to create a transparent, tamper-evident audit ledger for critical business decisions in regulated environments.

The system is designed to ensure that decisions such as complaint resolutions, approvals, and policy changes can be independently verified, traced over time, and protected against unauthorised modification.

Rather than storing sensitive data directly on-chain, the project implements a hybrid architecture where cryptographic proofs are recorded on a blockchain while detailed records remain off-chain.

## Problem Statement

In regulated industries, decision records are often stored in mutable systems that rely heavily on internal controls and trust.

This creates challenges such as:
- Limited transparency in decision histories
- Difficulty proving data integrity during disputes
- Risk of retrospective modification
- Low audit confidence for regulators and customers

This project investigates how blockchain-based audit logging can strengthen trust, accountability, and traceability without exposing sensitive data.

## Objectives

- Design a tamper-evident audit ledger for critical decisions
- Implement cryptographic integrity verification using blockchain
- Enable traceability of decision lifecycles
- Provide analytical visibility through dashboards and metrics
- Evaluate trade-offs between blockchain and traditional systems

---

## Scope

This repository focuses on:
- Decision audit logging
- Integrity verification
- Traceability analysis
- Transparency metrics

All data used in this repository is synthetic and anonymised.
